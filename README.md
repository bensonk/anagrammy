# Anagrammy

This is a simple tool that builds a tree in memory representing a wordlist.  The user is prompted to enter a string of letters, and the tool provides a list of words that can be made with the provided letters.  These are not, strictly speaking, anagrams, since some letters may be omitted if they aren't useful. This tool was originally built for finding optimal words in the PopCap game "Bookworm Adventures".  It's also useful for cheating at scrabble, and probably for a few other things as well.
